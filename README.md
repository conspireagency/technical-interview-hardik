Interview task

High level description 
We're going be be standing up a simple CRUD app using NestJS and a sample dataset.  It's going to have a few endpoints to demonstrate the creation of endpoints and queries.  An example dataset is provided in CSV form to populate the database with.  This is a task to demonstrate domain knowledge, derived from an API we stood up in the past for a client but in a much more simpler form.

Phase 1
-Get NestJS setup with your database of choice
-Please use an Entity / Schema definition.  For time purposes you don't need to create multiple tables (unless you want to), one table with all fields is fine.
-Write ingestion function to populate the database, the example file is quite large so first 3k rows should be fine.

Phase 2
-Create an endpoint that allows you to add a new row to the database with a Year + Make + Model + Submodel + Notes + Part Number + Size Code

Phase 3
-Create a module that will serve for car/part lookup
-It should have multiple endpoints
  1. Endpoint returns all years
  2. Endpoint that returns all Makes available for a given Year
  3. Endpoint that returns all Models available for a given Year + Makes combination
  4. Endpoint that returns all Submodels available for a given Year + Makes + Model combination
  5. Endpoint that returns all Notes available for a given Year + Makes + Model + Submodel combination
  6. Endpoint that returns Part Number + Size Code given a Year + Make + Model + Submodel + Notes combination

Bonus Discussion
-Given more time how would you better structure the database?
-The example dataset only covers a certain product.  How would you structure the database if other products were added (say a separate csv, similar format) that contained cars outside of the given set?
-Assuming that the data sets were updated in the future given a similar csv and the csv was sufficiently large like this one (70,000k+ lines), how would you handle subsequent updates to eliminate downtime while the database was being updated?
